                <p>My role: Project Lead, Level Designer </p>
                <p>This is a Doom II annual community project that I lead. Naturally, BirminDoom is experimental in nature, and this year's iteration aims to seriously change original Doom's formula, so I expect a lot of work with ZScript.</p>
                <p>BirminDoom 2023: my contributions: </p>

                    <li>Hub map for levels (implementation + concept)</li>

                <p>Some takeaways:</p>
                <ul class="skill-list">
                    <li>Used scripting to affect gameplay in my map: took away weapons from the player, teleported enemies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Learnt a lot about how to give feedback in a supportive manner. it helped some maps to be clearer with their intentions.</li>
                    <li>The project is powered by David Newton's RAMPART, so I got some experience reading code made by someone else.</li>

                <h2>Crunchy Wants Cake</h2>
                <h4>Global Game Jam 2024 (January 26-28, 2024)</h4>
                <p>My role: Programmer, Audio Design</p>
                <p>Tech used: Unity, C#</p>
                <p>In this project, I handled technical aspects, from setting up a version control with Git LFS to making some major architecture decisions.

                    I went with the following solution:
                    <ul  class="skill-list">
                        <li>Isolated reading input and passing it to other scripts with a Singleton class Controls. Initially, we had different kinds of input, and it was important to have this functionality within a single script.</li>
                        <li>a Singleton class StateManager stored references to gameObjects of the separate game states, and a method that disables the current game state and enables a new one.</li>
                        <li>Each state had its own gameObject. It also made referencing in editor much easier.</li>
                        <li>Each state class in a C# script inherited from an abstract BaseState class that allowed for overriding Start() and Update() methods.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This solution allowed 4 coders to work on their own respective states with a very small amount of merge conflicts in the end. What was also important is that the team had varying experience with game programming, so this solution, though not very optimized, allowed for a quick implementation into the workflow of all members.

                <h2>Bubble Clicker</h2>
                <h4>February 2024</h4>
                <p>My role: Game Designer, Programmer</p>
                <p>Tech used: C++, SFML</p>
                <p>Having learnt the basics of SFML and C++, I tried to make my own small game from scratch. I decided to make a small clicker, where the player is to click as many bubbles as they can within a time limit of 30 seconds.

                    In this small project I dealt on my own with:
                    
                    <ul  class="skill-list">
                        <li>Alignment of sprites and text using code (though implementation was in SFML, the concepts can be well translated into game engines). </li>
                        <li>Adding a timer countdown that is properly displayed in game. </li>
                        <li>C++11 Random Number Generation. </li>
                        <li>How and when should the program generate random positions for bubbles. 100 positions are calculated at the start-up, and stored in a std::vector. The game goes through a vector one by one, whenever the bubble is popped. </li>
                        <li>Changing states (the game screen and game related UI are not shown, while not in game session). </li>
                        <li>Making game replayable in one session (where and how to reset variables so that the game can be replayed without any exceptions). </li>
                    </ul>

                    For this project I decided not to make separate classes and methods, all of the functionality is in main() function. However, if I decide to proceed further with the project, a better code organization will be introduced.
                    <br>
                    Apart from code organization, certain features can be introduced or fixed:
                    <ul  class="skill-list">
                        <li> Better randomization of positions. </li>
                        <li> Simple animation to show a successful click. </li>
                        <li> Randomize bubble's radius within a defined range. </li>
                        <li> Introduce power-ups (e.g. time limit extension). </li>
                        <li> Make more bubbles appear on screen and add a lifetime to them. </li>
                    </ul>

                        <p class="skill-list">The project is based on Nathan Farrer’s Unity Multiplayer course. My contribution is that instead of the PvP, I created a co-op game where players compete against swarms of enemies. 
                            Hence, all the logic around enemies (spawning, their movement, damage) and scores (with leaderboard that can be toggled) are made by me.
                            Also, the course had tanks as avatar, and the movement needed to be adjusted for a humanoid cyborg.
                            These changes also needed to account for client-server architecture</p>

                            <li>The project started when I had very little experience with Unity, therefore, I feel like it is too far away from being good, but I learnt a lot about the necessity of a well-designed codebase.</li>
                            <li>I also learned about the concepts related to netcode, and networking in games.</li>
